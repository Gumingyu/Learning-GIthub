This is going to be my first step to enter the coding world. And github is a platform that can be really helpful on the journey to be a code guru.(Ambitius üòé)
So Github is the first station.

## Github 

**1.Understand Git Basics**
Repository
Commit
Branch
Merge
Pull Request

**2.Setup Github Account**
Visit GitHub's website and create an account.
Once signed up, explore your dashboard. It‚Äôs where you‚Äôll see updates from repositories you follow or contribute to.

**3.Create Your First Repository**
Click the "+" icon in the upper right corner of your GitHub dashboard, then select "New repository."
Name your repository, add a brief description, decide if you want it to be public or private, and initialize it with a README file (this serves as the introductory documentation for your project).

**4.Make and Commit Changes**
Click on your repository, open the README file, and click the pencil icon (edit).
After making changes (like adding a description of your project), scroll down, write a commit message describing your changes, and click on "Commit changes."

**5.Branching**
Back in your repository, click on the ‚ÄúBranch: main‚Äù button.
Type a name for your new branch, then click ‚ÄúCreate branch.‚Äù Now you can make changes without affecting the main branch.

**6.Open a Pull Request(PR)**
* Make some changes in your new branch, then go to the "Pull requests" tab and click "New pull request."
* Seclect your branch and compare it with the main branch. Review the changes, then click "Create pull request." Add a title and description to your changes.
* When you're ready, click on "Create pull request."

**7.Merge your Pull Request**
* Once your PR is reviewed and ready to go, you can merge it into the main branch. Click "Merge pull request" and then "Confirm merge."
*  Optionally, you can delete the branch after the merge as it's no longer needed.
