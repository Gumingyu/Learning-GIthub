This is going to be my first step to enter the coding world. And github is a platform that can be really helpful on the journey to be a code guru.(Ambitius ðŸ˜Ž)
So Github is the first station.

Github 

1.Understand Git Basics
Repository
Commit
Branch
Merge
Pull Request

2.Setup Github Account
Visit GitHub's website and create an account.
Once signed up, explore your dashboard. Itâ€™s where youâ€™ll see updates from repositories you follow or contribute to.

3.Create Your First Repository
Click the "+" icon in the upper right corner of your GitHub dashboard, then select "New repository."
Name your repository, add a brief description, decide if you want it to be public or private, and initialize it with a README file (this serves as the introductory documentation for your project).

4.Make and Commit Changes
Click on your repository, open the README file, and click the pencil icon (edit).
After making changes (like adding a description of your project), scroll down, write a commit message describing your changes, and click on "Commit changes."
